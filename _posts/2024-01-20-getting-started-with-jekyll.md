# Getting Started with Jekyll: A Developer's Guide

Jekyll is a powerful static site generator that's perfect for blogs, documentation sites, and portfolios. In this guide, we'll walk through everything you need to know to get started with Jekyll.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby. It takes your content written in Markdown, applies layouts and templates, and generates a complete static website that you can host anywhere.

### Key Benefits

- **Fast Performance**: Static sites load incredibly quickly
- **Security**: No database or server-side code means fewer security vulnerabilities  
- **Version Control**: Your entire site can be managed with Git
- **GitHub Pages Integration**: Free hosting with automatic deployment

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before installing Jekyll, make sure you have:

1. **Ruby** (version 2.5.0 or higher)
2. **RubyGems**
3. **GCC and Make**

### Installing Jekyll

```bash
# Install Jekyll and Bundler
gem install jekyll bundler

# Create a new Jekyll site
jekyll new my-awesome-site

# Navigate to your site directory
cd my-awesome-site

# Build and serve your site locally
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Your site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Understanding Jekyll Structure

A typical Jekyll site has the following structure:

```
my-site/
â”œâ”€â”€ _config.yml          # Configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ _data/              # Data files (YAML, JSON, CSV)
â”œâ”€â”€ _drafts/            # Unpublished posts
â”œâ”€â”€ _includes/          # Reusable components
â”œâ”€â”€ _layouts/           # Page templates
â”œâ”€â”€ _posts/             # Blog posts
â”œâ”€â”€ _sass/              # Sass stylesheets
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/             # Images, CSS, JS files
â”œâ”€â”€ _site/              # Generated site (don't edit)
â””â”€â”€ index.html          # Homepage
```

### Key Directories Explained

#### `_layouts`
Contains templates that wrap around your content. Common layouts include:
- `default.html` - Base template
- `post.html` - Blog post template
- `page.html` - Static page template

#### `_includes`
Reusable components like headers, footers, and navigation that can be included in layouts.

#### `_posts`
Your blog posts, named with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

## Configuration with `_config.yml`

The `_config.yml` file is where you configure your site settings:

```yaml
title: My Awesome Blog
description: A blog about web development and technology
baseurl: "" # subpath of your site
url: "https://yourdomain.com"

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
highlighter: rouge
theme: minima

# Plugins
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
  - jekyll-sitemap
  - jekyll-seo-tag

# Collections
collections:
  projects:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:name/
```

## Writing Your First Post

Create a new file in the `_posts` directory:

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "My First Jekyll Post"
date: 2024-01-20 10:00:00 -0500
categories: [blogging, jekyll]
tags: [first-post, learning]

# Hello Jekyll!

This is my first post using Jekyll. I'm excited to explore
all the features this static site generator has to offer.

## What I've Learned So Far

- Jekyll uses Liquid templating
- Posts are written in Markdown
- Front matter controls post metadata
```

## Customizing Your Site

### Creating Custom Layouts

```html
<!-- _layouts/post.html -->
---
layout: default
---

<article class="post">
  <header class="post-header">
    <h1 class="post-title">{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">
      <time datetime="{{ page.date | date_to_xmlschema }}">
        {{ page.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}
      </time>
    </p>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    {{ content }}
  </div>
</article>
```

### Using Liquid Templating

Jekyll uses Liquid for templating. Here are some common patterns:

```liquid
<!-- Loop through posts -->
{% for post in site.posts %}
  <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
  <p>{{ post.excerpt }}</p>
{% endfor %}

<!-- Conditional content -->
{% if page.featured_image %}
  <img src="{{ page.featured_image }}" alt="{{ page.title }}">
{% endif %}

<!-- Include components -->
{% include header.html %}
```

## Deployment Options

### GitHub Pages (Free)

1. Create a repository named `username.github.io`
2. Push your Jekyll site to the repository
3. Your site will be available at `https://username.github.io`

### Netlify

1. Connect your Git repository to Netlify
2. Set build command: `jekyll build`
3. Set publish directory: `_site`
4. Deploy automatically on every push

### Custom Server

Build your site and upload the `_site` directory:

```bash
# Build for production
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build

# Upload _site directory to your server
```

## Performance Tips

### Optimize Images
- Use appropriate image formats (WebP when possible)
- Compress images before adding to your site
- Consider lazy loading for better performance

### Minimize CSS and JavaScript
```yaml
# _config.yml
sass:
  style: compressed

# Use Jekyll plugins for minification
plugins:
  - jekyll-minifier
```

### Use a CDN
Consider using a CDN for faster global content delivery.

## Conclusion

Jekyll is an excellent choice for developers who want full control over their site while enjoying the benefits of static site generation. With its powerful templating system, extensive plugin ecosystem, and seamless GitHub Pages integration, Jekyll makes it easy to create fast, secure, and maintainable websites.

Whether you're building a personal blog, portfolio, or documentation site, Jekyll provides the flexibility and performance you need. Start with the basics covered in this guide, and gradually explore more advanced features as your needs grow.

Happy Jekyll-ing! ðŸš€
